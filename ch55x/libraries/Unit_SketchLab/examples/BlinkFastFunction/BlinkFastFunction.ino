/*
  Blink

  Turns an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.

  Most Arduinos have an on-board LED you can control. On the simpleCH552
  it is attached to digital pin P3.3

  this example uses marco-based function to accelerate IO access speed. 
  Note these functions will not disable analog output(PWM)
  And they only accept constants.

  If you want to know what pin the on-board LED is connected to on your Arduino
  model, check the Technical Specs of your board at:
